# Tapscript Lib

Tapscript Lib is both a node.js library and an integrated demo for tapscript developers. We wrapped the most commonly used tapscript as a module for developers. You can build taproot-related apps in a more easy way.

## Test Environment

To run Bitcoin locally, we could use regtest network to easily test the lib. The following module is required to build regtest:

bitcoind
bitcoin-cli

We suggest getting them directly on the Bitcoin Core official site:

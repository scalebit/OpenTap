#### Misc / Minor

* cleanup trailing whitespace: https://github.com/janoside/btc-rpc-explorer/commit/abccbcced24a3299b559166f8c4b58a33f9008d0#comments


* "utils.js" accessible from frontend JS code (to avoid some of /snippet?)

* move to simpler variable structure - remove "result.getblock" kind of structure in favor of "block"
* don't double-get the block for /block-height pages (maybe /block pages too): in action handler "getBlockByHeight" is called, then "getBlockByHashWithTransactions", which internally calls "getBlockByHash"
* get rid of magic numbers (e.g. 100,000,000)
* re-visit the old "conflicted results" concept in electrumAddressApi (it's been removed from UI when moving to v3, but maybe should return)

* cache difficulty data on /diff-hist page, so subsequent runs are super fast (tiny amt of data to cache)
* cache miner data on /mining-summary page, so subsequent runs are super fast (tiny amt of data to cache)


* UTXO status on outputs on all txLists (transaction page is done, need to add block page, address page, test/tx-list page)
